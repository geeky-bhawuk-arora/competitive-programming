Problem Statement

Yash's Secure Locker: The Digital Root Password

Yash owns a special locker to securely store his important letters. This locker has an advanced password mechanism. The password is determined based on the number of letters stored inside the locker. If there are letters, the password is the digital root of n.

Your task is to write a program that calculates the password for the locker given the number of letters n.

Digital Root:

The digital root (also known as the repeated digital sum) of a number is the single-digit value obtained by iteratively summing the digits of the number until a single-digit result is achieved.

For example:
The digital root of 123 is calculated as follows: 1+2+3=6
The result is 6, a single digit, so the digital root is 6.

Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer t , representing the number of test cases.
For each test case a single line is input containing a single positive integer representing the number of letters in the locker.

Constraints

1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5
n is a positive integer.
n can be very large, up to 10^5

Output Format
A single integer, the digital root of n

Sample Input
2
123
9876


Output
6
3

Explanation:

Test Case 1:

123→1+2+3=6


Test Case 2:

9876→9+8+7+6=30→3+0=3
